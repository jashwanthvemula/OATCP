Calculate Maximum Product:

    Initialize three variables prevMax, prevMin, and maxProduct to the first element of the array.
    Iterate through the array starting from the second element:
        Calculate the current maximum product considering the current element, the product of the previous maximum with the current element, and the product of the previous minimum with the current element. This is done to handle negative numbers (a negative number multiplied by another negative number gives a positive product, which might become the maximum product).
        Update prevMax and prevMin with the calculated values for the next iteration.
        Update maxProduct with the maximum of the current maximum product and the previously calculated maximum product.
    The final maxProduct obtained after the iteration represents the maximum product of any three integers from the array.
